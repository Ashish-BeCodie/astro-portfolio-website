## UI Design

**Design Inspirations:**
Inspiration assists us with brainstorming, mapping out new ideas and with bringing these new ideas to life.
As designers, inspiration assists us with keeping our creativity alive. When we are innovative, we are able to produce ideas that have never been seen before.

**Icons:**
Icons are an essential part of many user interfaces, visually expressing objects, actions and ideas. When done correctly, they communicate the core idea and intent of a product or action, and they bring a lot of nice benefits to user interfaces.

Illustrations have the unique potential to add emotion, clarity, and beauty to your user interface. They enrich the user experience your site delivers by getting the main point across faster than text and engaging the user through their journey.

**Font Icons:**
To boost the development process of web apps and websites. I always try to use font libraries.
Most of the time I use "Fontello", Why?
- Because I use custom SVG icons from different sites. which I don't find in font libraries.
- Fontello allows us to add custom SVG icons by drag and drop. Then we can download CSS and font files for our Web Apps and Websites. Basically, you are creating your own font library.
